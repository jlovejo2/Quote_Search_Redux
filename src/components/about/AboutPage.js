      This app uses React, Redux, React Router, and many other helpful libraries
      to create the functionality. It uses all third-party-apis to generate the
      quotes and jokes the those pages. Boostrap and Bootstrap-react are used as
      the main front-end/responsiveness css styling frameworks.
